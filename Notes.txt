State can be stored using several approaches. Each approach is described later in this topic.

1) Cookies	
Cookies are often used for personalization, where content is customized for a known user. 
The user is only identified and not authenticated in most cases.
The cookie can store the user's name, account name, or unique user ID (such as a GUID). 
You can then use the cookie
to access the user's personalized settings, such as their preferred website background color.



2)Session state	
ASP.NET Core maintains session state by providing a cookie to the client that contains a session ID,
which is sent to the app with each request. 
The app uses the session ID to fetch the session data.
Because the session cookie is specific to the browser, 
sessions aren't shared across browsers.
If a cookie is received for an expired session,
a new session is created that uses the same session cookie.
 Session state cookies aren't marked essential by default

3)TempData	 
Query strings	 
Hidden fields	 
HttpContext.Items	 
Cache	 
Dependency Injection	

Cached data isn't associated with a specific request, user, or session. 
Be careful not to cache user-specific data that may be retrieved by other users' requests.
